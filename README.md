# Water-Light-Show---CS207
Abstract: Some people may consider the speaker one of the greatest inventions ever made and that is used literally everywhere in our modern day society. Everywhere you go speakers can be found whether it’s used for listing to music, in your telephones, for medical reasons like hearing aids, and for many others. It is no surprise that the speaker is used in so many different ways and places but what else can be do with these wonderful pieces of technology. The easiest answer to that is to find a way to modernize this piece of technology and give it some flare by using skills in programming to bring it to the next level. This proposal is asking for the permission to conduct a project where we use modern technology of an Arduino to add lights and water to go along with a basic old speaker to give you a full on light and water show of a lifetime. The overall idea for the complete project is to have an Arduino powered by a battery pack so it can be taken wherever it is needed. For easy accessibility will have an auxiliary port so all phones or devices can be connected to play music through the sounds system. From here there will be a code written that will take the audio from the user’s device and sync lights to the music as well as a few water pumps. When all is done music should be played through the speaker well the Arduino takes the music and processes it into code that can then be sued to make lights and the water pumps go off synced to the music.

Instalation: First thing you need to do is make sure you have both the arduino software and processing on your computer. Secondly follow the exact guide that I post in the link below because this was the base and starting block of our project. Follow the assembly steps as well as the software steps to get the code adn basic software needed to run the program. Make sure also taht you not only put the processing and Arduino code in the Loibraries file but also the Minim one as well.

This is the basics once you have all of that completed take the code we have and copy it overtop of the processing code you start with not the listener but the main one. The code will change often since we intend to modify and addd alot to it as well as the hardware mite change ocne weadd more but we will give further instructios about taht ocne it happens.

Manifest: For files that you need to have make sure that you get all of the files mentioned in the instalation link. That include the code as well as teh three seperate libraries that processing needs in order to operate the codes. I tried to include the folders for the libraries on github but it would not work so you will have to get them or read how to get them from the link above.
