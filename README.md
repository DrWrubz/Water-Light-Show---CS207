# Water-Light-Show---CS207
Abstract: Some people may consider the speaker one of the greatest inventions ever made and that it is used literally everywhere in our modern day society. Everywhere you go speakers can be found whether it’s used for listening to music, in your telephones, for medical reasons like hearing aids, and for many other reasons. It is no surprise that the speaker is used in so many different ways and places but what else can we do with these wonderful pieces of technology. The easiest answer to that is to find a way to modernize this piece of technology and give it some flare by using skills in programming to bring it to the next level. This proposal is asking for the permission to conduct a project where we use modern technology of an Arduino to add lights and water to go along with a basic old speaker to give you a full on light and water show of a lifetime. This project will be complete through a computer playing any music files. From here there will be a code written that will take the audio from the user’s computer and sync lights to the music as well as a few water pumps. When all is done music should be played through the computer well the Arduino takes the music and processes it into code that can then be used to make lights and the water pumps go off synced to the music.

Instalation: First thing you need to do is make sure you have both the arduino software and processing on your computer. Then on your breadboard, set up 6 L.E.D lights to your arduino through the digital pins. We used pins 11,10,9,6,5,3. Take the arduino and processing code out of our repository. Upload the arduino code to the arduino first, then run the processing code next. Also, make sure that your computers "audio out" is also coming in. 

Manifest: Make sure you have both the arduino and processing files from our repository. Make sure that you have the proper libraries installed on processing Ex) Minim.
